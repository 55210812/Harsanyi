Her acting never fails to impress
A rating of 1 does not begin to express how dull, depressing and relentlessly bad this movie is
Hated it with all my being. Worst movie ever. Mentally- scarred. Help me. It was that bad. TRUST ME!!!
This is a good film. This is very funny. Yet after this film there were no good Ernest films!
The characters are unlikeable and the script is awful. It's a waste of the talents of Deneuve and Auteuil.
I don't know why I like this movie so well, but I never get tired of watching it.
If you like Pauly Shore, you'll love Son in Law. If you hate Pauly Shore, then, well... I liked it!
This is the definitive movie version of Hamlet. Branagh cuts nothing, but there are no wasted moments.
Without a doubt, one of Tobe Hoppor's best! Epic storytellng, great special effects, and The Spacegirl (vamp me baby!).
Add this little gem to your list of holiday regulars. It is sweet, funny, and endearing
no comment - stupid movie, acting average or worse... screenplay - no sense at all... SKIP IT!
