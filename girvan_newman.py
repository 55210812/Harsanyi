    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
    most_valuable_edge : function, optional
        Function that takes a graph as input and outputs an edge. If None, uses modularity gain.
    weight : string or None, optional (default="weight")
        The edge attribute that holds the numerical value used as a weight.
    threshold : float, optional (default=0.0000001)
        Modularity gain threshold for stopping the algorithm.
    target_num_communities : int, optional
        Target number of communities to stop at. If None, uses modularity threshold.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        A list of sets (partition of `G`). Each set represents one community and contains
        all the nodes that constitute it.
